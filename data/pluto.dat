Hubble images show Pluto's surface is a mass of bright and <br>
dark areas attributed to frozen nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide.  <br>
<br>
Darker areas are supposedly the result of photochemical reactions from cosmic rays.<br>
Pluto has polar caps and dark spots near its equator.  <br>
<br>
As Pluto gets closer to the sun, the methane and nitrogen thaw <br>
and form a temporary atmosphere.</body></html>
