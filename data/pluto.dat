Dwarf Planet
(30% smaller than Earth's moon)<br>

Hubble images show Pluto's surface is a mass of bright and
dark areas attributed to frozen nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide.

Darker areas are supposedly the result of photochemical reactions from cosmic rays.
Pluto has polar caps and dark spots near its equator.

As Pluto gets closer to the sun, the methane and nitrogen thaw
and form a temporary atmosphere.
